/**
 * For any deterministic game, especially one that may use asset streaming, access to a central mechanism for the
 * creation, registration, and initialization of physics objects and ecs pillar components becomes essential.
 *
 * Deterministic ordering is bog simple.
 * It offers these categories.
 * Pillars - these come online during INITIALIZE.
 * During BeginPlay: (ugh, might need to change the lifecycle for this subsystem)
 * Player Key Carries (Reserved) - Player key carries, in the same order as players.
 * Key Carries (Reserved) - All key non-player carries, and only key carries.
 * Players (Reserved) - remote and local game instances must initialize the player objects in the same order for determinism. 
 * 1
 * Reserved
 * 2
 * Reserved
 * 3
 * Reserved
 * All Started
 *
 * And during its begin play, it runs anything registered with it. That's it. It may do more eventually.

//There are native ways to do this which might be better, but unfortunately, I can't be sure we'll
//only need to order UE-ish stuff for declaring dependencies.
//
//There's a couple other reasons to build it this way, since you really aren't supposed
//to do stuff like order the initialization of player objects separately from their creation order
//or order components on separate actors relative to each other but we do actually need to do that
//because for deterministic physics, the body creation order must be identical. This isn't a problem
//once play starts and we're building the sim off of the input stream but until then, we need ordering.
//I'd like to be wrong, but I don't think I am - a lot of games have something like this, a sort of
//hidden ordination mechanism built into resource loading. Especially if you have to lazy load.
//Additionally, each client would otherwise likely not possess the correct order as the local player object
//needs to be created in a totally different place and way from the proxies.
//Hopefully, as we learn more, we can remove this pillar, but I unfortunately doubt that.

//this will need, eventually, to be reworked to use the MassSubsystemAccess.h design for both sanity andd compatibility reasons.
