//this is a busy-style thread, which runs preset bodies of work in a specified order. Generally, the goal is that it never
//actually sleeps. In fact, it yields rather than sleeps, in general operation.
// 
// This is similar to but functionally very different from a work-stealing or task model like what we see in rust.
// 
// 
// The artilleryworker needs to be kept fairly busy or it will melt one cpu core yield-cycling. to be honest, worth it.
// no, seriously. with all the other sacrifices we've made occupying one core with game-sim physics, reconciliation,
// rollbacks, and pattern matching is a pretty good bargain. we'll want to revisit this for servers, of course.
