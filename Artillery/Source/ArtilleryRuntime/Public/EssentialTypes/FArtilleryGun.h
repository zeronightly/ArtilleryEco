/**
 * * GUNS MUST BE INITIALIZED. This is handled in the various loaders and builders, but any unique gun MUST be initialized.
 * This class will be a data-driven instance of a gun that encapsulates a generic structured ability,
 * then exposes bindings for the phases of that ability as a component to be bound as specific gameplay abilities.
 *
 * 
 * Artillery gun is a not a UObject. This allows us to safely interact with it off the game thread TO AN EXTENT.
 *
 * Ultimately, we'll need something like https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/concurrency/ConcurrentHashMap.h
 * if we want to get serious about this.
