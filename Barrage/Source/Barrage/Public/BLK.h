//BLK Ring is an extension of our existing ConservedStream that uses what I've been calling a FAFO [sic] queuing model
//and a producer-authored consumer assignment model to produce a lockless and atomic-free design.
//You read that right.

//It takes a lot of memory but it's worth it.
//this is a specialized form because to be honest, it's easier to understand C++ code that doesn't make super heavy use of templates
//and I think the actual need for this in our codebase is quite limited in many ways. So this version uses transforms, but it's a general
//pattern. Everything involved needs to be both trivially copiable and trivially destructible. Think of it as flat records with no foreign keys.

	//The Blackout Lockless Kibitz-free (BLK) Ring is a ring of ring buffers, with consumer responsibilities divided by a hash ring modulo. 
	// Blackout refers to the process of maintaining a deadzone between the read and write heads, effectively using space as
	// time by calculating the max permissible imbalance between producer and consumer. Without the use of atomics, this is a probabilitic
	// stopping approach, but with the default constants on display here, the chances of a failed stop are lower than a hash collision.
	
	//Locks are not used at any point in the design. We use a set of atomics to coordinate at the start of the job, but after that
	//we are "kibitz-free." No cross-talk occurs during running jobs. This is achieved using the hash ring modulo design
	//common to DHTs. In fact, this is very close to being a hash table if you look at it sideways.
	
	//I won't lie. It's a strange design, built out of a number of normal lockless designs. I don't think it's necessarily
	//novel, but I've never seen it used elsewhere. It is fairly niche for reasons you'll see, but there's a chance it may be new.
	
	//This class exists to bind them all... Err... It exists to provide an example of the BLK Ring offering
	//N producer, M consumer streaming for variable sized records with no locks and no atomics. In our case, we use
	//it for moving transforms around, especially grouped transforms like sets of bones.
	
	//To achieve this, we pay a quite significant memory cost, and do some very weird things.
	//
	// first, this is based on designs from all over, from capn proto to various existing approaches.
	// It's not quite the same as any I'm aware of, because we can guarantee both trivial copy and trivial destruct.
	// I'm not claiming to have invented this, but I can't for the life of me remember seeing it before. On the other hand,
	// I probably read about a data structure every couple weeks and probably have for the last 20 years. If this is your
	// design, please let me know! --JMK!
	
	// BLK Ring works by giving each CONSUMER a modulo value that represents their slice of a hash ring using the hash ring modulo
	// design common to almost all distributed hash tables. Each producer gets its own buffer. 
	// 
	// production is pretty simple:
	// Each record gets a hash generated and committed by the producer
	// the record is written to the stream, in this case the bones stream, then the meta data is recorded in the records
	// 
	// We write the timestamp last. as a result, we allow false negatives but no false positives or incomplete records.
	// to consume, a consumer sweeps through the record stream of each producer's buffer, starting where it left off last time
	// then checks to see if the hash falls into its part of the hash ring. if so, it uses it, if not, it doesn't.
	//
	// we use a small deadzone to let the system know that we've begun to write over ourselves. this region is not addressable
	// and is relatively large. this ensures that in practical cases, a record will never be read while partially written, without
	// using any atomics. in fact, we use no atomics at all, instead using a bit of thread local state here and there, and
	// incurring the cost of reviewing all records on all consumers. fortunately, this is quite small, and we only perform work
	// if the record matches our modulo. this means that even if the producers are uneven, the hash should be, which means that
	// consumer workload is kept even without explicit round robining or similar, and requires no communication. only the intended
	// recipient will ever read a record, so we don't need to do things like mark them read. likewise, because we do need to look at
	// each record with each consumer, and our records are trivially destructible, we don't need a shared value for read heads.
	/*
	 * These work across worlds but not across BLK prototypes. 
	 * These should generally be thread local and hermetically contained in the task itself. This means that you should
